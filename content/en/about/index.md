### Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

Welcome to **It's Technically Useful**, a technology blog brought to you by [Conservation
Colorado](https://conservationco.org/), created by [Oliver](https://github.com/OliverAbdulrahim)!

This blog is  [**inclusive**](#inclusive), [**free**](#free), and [**trustworthy**](#trustworthy). Continue below to
learn more!

#### Inclusive

I talk about technology through an inclusive lens.

I achieve this by **calling out the scariness, shame, and guilt** associated with learning about technology, then
**dismantling it.** You may have experienced these bad feelings before. For example, you may have asked a question, only
to get dismissed with a patronizing "you *really* don't know how to do that?"

People shame each other like this all the time. They do it for many reasons. Sometimes, to feel superior. Other times,
because they're threatened by others' curiosity. Or maybe they're transferring whatever trauma they have on to you...
you're welcome! Black and brown folks, women, and LGBTQ+ people experience these at work as microaggressions because of
assumptions and stereotypes about our competence and technical ability.

Although this blog talks about technology, I **center the human experience** in the way we interact with tech. That
means that I call out shame and guilt. Not knowing how to do something carries no moral judgement. *Bilaks* (Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø¹ÙƒØ³ --
Arabic word that basically means "it's totally contrary"), it's an exciting time of learning new things! And I will
always write in a way that makes no assumptions about you.

#### Free

This project is all about free.

I'm not just talking about free as in free lunch. While that does sound delicious right about now, and this website is
never going to cost you anything to access, I'm going beyond that. I care about **empowering people** to use
technology, creating opportunities for **collaborating** while learning, and having **unrestricted access** to
materials that can help you do more in your work.

I achieve this by making this
project [entirely open source](https://github.com/ConservationColorado/conservationcolorado.github.io), forever and
always. This makes the information I present to you auditable, extendable, and transparent.

#### Trustworthy

You can rest assured that this site is a **safe place to stay** and **learn quality, well-researched** information.

Everything is written by
us -- [look for the green "Verified" tag here](https://github.com/ConservationColorado/conservationcolorado.github.io/commits/main).

Also, I will never try to sell you anything! No advertisements or sponsored content. No spammy pop-ups, paywalls,
referral links, auto-playing sound, chatbots, or any of the other horrors of the modern web.

Anyone can access the content of this site, whether through a screen reader, text to speech, a mobile device, and more.
You may also appreciate dark mode -- enable it in the navigation bar!

### What's in a name?

I like to call this site and blog "technically useful" because it's useful, technically.

As you can tell, this is a semi-serious name. Don't get me wrong, I think this is important work! At the same time, I
want to dismantle the scariness, shame, and guilt associated with technology. Learn more about why [here](#inclusive).
