The process of verifying what things you can access within a secure system.

Authorization can take a few forms:

1. Based on entities: `user`, `admin`, `super-admin`
2. Based on roles: `viewer`, `commenter`, `editor`
3. Based on granted scopes: `read` access, `write` access, `read-write` access

This term is all about *what* you have access to within a given system.
Closely related but distinct is [authentication](#authentication), which is
all about *who* has access.
