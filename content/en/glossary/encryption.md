The process of scrambling plain information in a special way (using cryptographic algorithms) to
make that data more secure, or *encrypted*. The reverse of this process is called *decryption*.

Encrypted data is hidden to anyone without the one key that can unscramble or decrypt the data.
This protects the information from unauthorized access.

People have protected information with encryption long before the age of modern computing. Today,
encryption is used widely for storing data like passwords, for communication that's protected
from eavesdropping, for securing online transactions, and much more. It's the backbone of privacy
online.
