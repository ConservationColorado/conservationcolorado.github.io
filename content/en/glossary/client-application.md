An application that acts on behalf of a user in an OAuth context.

The client acts as a go-between for the
[resource owner](#resource-owner), who grants authority, the
[authorization server](#authorization-server), which validates the
user and client, and the [resource server](#resource-server),
which keeps the resource owner's data.
