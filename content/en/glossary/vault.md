In the context of [password managers](#password-manager), a vault is a digital container that stores
and manages secrets such as passwords, credit card information, API keys, tokens, and more. Vaults
protect that stored data using [encryption](#encryption). This process protects the vault from
unauthorized access and involves a password which the user sets, which is often called the
[main password](#main-password).
