The process of proving your identity before you can access a secure system.

Authentication is all about proving that you are who you say that you are.
Some methods to *authenticate* someone include passwords, biometrics (facial
recognition, fingerprint verification), and cryptographic keys.

This term is all about *who*. Related, but distinct is
[authorization](#authorization), which is all about *what* you can access.
